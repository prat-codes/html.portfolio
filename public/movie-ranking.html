<h1>All time favorite movies</h1>

<h2>top 5 movies of all time (bollywood version) </h2>
<hr />

<h2>Shiddat</h2>
<p>Romance is pretty much the stuff that i love to watch so this is my most favorite and hence it tops the list.</p>

<h2>Ae dil hai mushkil</h2>
<p>Such a masterpiece! Who wouldn't love this track? OMG! I personally love this movie cause it has everything a watcher needs to satisfy their binge-watching hunger. The story omg i'd die to watch it over and over again and for sure laugh and cry ever single time. (I love karan johar for this art)</p>
<h2>Zindagi na milegi dobara</h2>
<p>This movie is purely based on those little moments in life that often many of us tend to forget or ignore or totally neglect but as the title of the movie says it all "zindagi na milegi dobara" which when translated basically means "one will never live again".</p>

<h2>Yeh jawani hai deewani</h2>
<p>You know how college friends group is most of the times and this movie totally depicts that college life trip and there are peeks of romance too, again this on too decribes LIFE.</p>

<h2>Kuch kuch hota hai</h2>
<p>Now I don't know why this movie gets fifth place but it is something i have watched like a hundred times and everytime i watch this movie, trust me, kuch kuch hota hai</p>
